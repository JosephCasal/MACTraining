Review polymorphism, parcelable is polymorphism




Onpause is partially visible (like alert dialog box
Onstop is not visible

2 activities:

1st	oncreate
	onstart
	onresume
(Gotosecondactivity)
	onpause
2nd	oncreate
	onstart
	onresume
1st	onstop



Clear your resources in onstop


bundle can have multiple intents
Bundle is used mostly to communicate between different components or threads

Can restrict app to portrait or landscape in the manifest for each activity
Android:screenOrientation=“portrait”

To handle all the config changes yourself
Android:configChanges=“screenSize|orientation|keyboardHidden”



Difference between serializable and parcelable, most common question in interview, remember the method names what each does and the whole process

When you want to send object to components, data needs to be converted to byte code.
Intent converts to byte code but they need to implement the interfaces
Serializable used in java, uses reflection creates a copy, creates an object, uses more memory and time
Parcelable used in android, does not use reflection we write down each field and convert it ourselves, for marshaling it calls writeToParcel, for second activity it uses the creator field and createfromparcel. fields: creator[createfromparcel, createfromarray], write to parcel, and describe content (usually 0)

Both Serializable and Pacelable are interfaces used for marshaling and unmarshaling

Marshaling and unmarshaling, convert to and from byte code so jvm can send it and unmarshaling is to turn it back


Explicit intent: when we tell the intent which component we want to start, what is the intent of the class
Implicit intent: when you don’t know which component will start, you set the type and action and the intent filter will know which component or app it will use.

Actions are set in the manifest



companies create a util package which has a class called CONSTANTS and has all the string and other constants
static class Actions{
	public static final String ACTION_PERSON_PARCELABLE = “personParcelable”;
	public static final String ACTION_PERSON_SERIALIZABLE = “personSerializable”;
}

And for keys
You should never hard code anything
