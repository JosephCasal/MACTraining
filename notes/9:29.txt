All activities are added to a back stack
So if you press back button it pops from the top of the stack

Handle back stack if you want different launch modes


Single top
When you have c and you call c again, it does not create a new instance just uses the same one, the data is received back on onnewintent(intent)

Single instance
When you have a somewhere in the stack (not on top) and call a again, it will pop all out until it gets to a and then pushes it again with a on top. Have to save everything for every activity on onnewintent

Single task
Android starts only one task by default, but can start new task ourselves.
Activity can only exist in one task.
Tasks will start multiple activities

Standard



Intent flags
A way to handle back stack programmatically
While sending intent you set flags and pass constant (SINGLE_TOP, SINGLE_INSTANCE, etc.)
Then that activity will start with that launch mode
