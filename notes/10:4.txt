Notes:

When you use nested recycler views you can attach to the view heairchy by passing true on .inflate


Glide android library for image loading


Fragments are reusable components
Like a login view and behavior for the buttons
Activity life cycle affects the fragment because they are attached to the parent activity

Fragments without ui is headless fragments
For behaviors without the ui.
can be used to save the data from an activity before it is destroyed and get the fragment by tag

Example:
When you see your list of emails on a fragment
Select an email
The list fragment is replaced by the email content fragment


Fragments donâ€™t get added to the back stack by default need to use .addtobackstack
fragment transaction lets us add or remove a fragment from the back stack
One fragment should never add another fragment, it can call the fragment transaction
The activity should have the control, know which fragment is at on top.
We use fragment manager to start the fragment transaction
