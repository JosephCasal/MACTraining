permissions
namespace




4 main components

Activities - UI part, class(logic) and xml(design) associated with it

Content provider - provide content from like a database, the content provider will connect and talk to database not the app

Services - used to perform long running tasks on android, play music but not staying on the app, like background services. With new threads you do long calculations or outside calls. Might consume too many resources

Broadcast receivers - interprocess communications, data from process to process, thread to thread, if app needs bluetooth to work and user turns it off need to notify user and broadcast receivers will listen if the user turns off bluetooth


Receivers and services need to be declared in the manifest






Testing

Integration testing -  how different modules are integrated together, test multiple classes and flow of data
Unit test - just test one method or class

Drawables - save any images, use different sizes for different screen sizes
Layout - constrained layout new layout, will be using linear layout in class to practice speed, relative is old way
Values - used throughout the whole app: colors, strings, styles (used in manifest or different activities
